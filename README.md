# Deutsche Post IT Franking Decoder

This is a utility webapp to decode the Data Matrix code used to frank domestic mailings in Germany. It is implemented according to the [documentation](https://www.deutschepost.de/content/dam/dpag/images/D_d/DV-Freimachung/downloads/dp-mlfvm-2-dv-freimachung_1.5.2_engl.pdf) provided by Deutsche Post.

The main intention is to determine the date of posting, but the webapp also shows some more available information.
